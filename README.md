# General Comments 
### Lesson 1 (10.22.23)
- learned how to start up a project (django-admin startproject ____) and add an app within the project (python manage.py startapp ____)
- learned about the files that automatically get generated along with how to start up the project (python manage.py runserver)

# Interesting Q&A
Why isn't the urls.py auto-generated? 
- sometimes apps only do internal things, urls.py is only useful routing users to pages specific to that app
